Scripts for running the VAC application
runmodeliome.sh	Generate and run vac models also generates                			metadata  and job documentation, job and model xml files
		can be used to rerun jobs and to form archive metadata 			describing how a model was built.xsl can be used to 			transform these to web content the data can be uploaded to 			xindice database

runmodel.sh     Basic generate and run vac models


The following tasks are performed
1. Compile and make vac and vacini applications
   (using specified Makefiles and user specified components 
    through the VAC setvac utility)

2. Run vacini and prepare ini files, if user specifies 
   a parallel application then the distributed ini is generated

3. Run vac
   (each of the features may be switched on and off if we are using the
service to run a parallel VAC application we will switch of the make 
option and the generate vacini option)

Both scripts require a simulationparams.sh and modelparams.sh file
these can be used to set the parameters or the defaults

There  is a parameter in simparams called general replacement files
this is the list of files which will be generated by making substitutions
using the general substitution parameters. A template file for each of the
files in this list will be appended with the word temp.


runmodeliome.sh can also take as input 2 files just the xml files they also
                require the template vacini.par and vac.par files
                there are 4 usecases that the user must specify on the 			command line the use cases are

#simmod creates sim and mod form default par file
#sim       creates new sim using default simfile mod read from iomodel.xml file
#mod	      creates new mod using default modfile sim read from iosim.xml

The default use case is 0 in this case runmodeliome.sh expects as input
a vacsimulation.xml file and then a vacmodel.xml file

runmodel.sh     edit the modelparams.sh and simulationparams.sh files these
                are taken as inputs for runmodel.sh


example
iome/runmodeliome.sh mod alf2dsimparams.sh  >& err.out
iome/runmodeliome.sh ../data/vacinputs/alfven2d_0.xml alfven2d_0 > tmp/err.txt

Notes about usage



Any generalreplacementfiles that are listed will have templates contained in a folder 
called templates the generated files will be copied to the tmp folder.

The xml file generated for a model will be copied to the xml folder

the tmp, xml and templates folder are in the inputsdirectory
